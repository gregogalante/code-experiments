/*
An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized,
flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon:

a[low : high]

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.
